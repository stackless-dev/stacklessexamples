Stackless RPC v0.1

Purpose
-------

This module is intended to allow tasklets to make synchronous calls across the
wire.  One of the benefits of Stackless, and other decent coroutine
implementations, is the ability to abstract away details in this manner so
that the programmer can write more readable code by avoiding broken
control flow.

Dependencies
------------

 * Stackless Python.
   - http://www.stackless.com
 * A monkeypatched replacement socket module.
